		<p title="im a tooltip"> <b> Misconceptions:</b></p> 
		<p>Skunks are mild-tempered, mostly nocturnal, small mammals. Skunks are often misunderstood when it comes to their defense mechanisms, as they <b><i>only</i></b> spray when being attacked. Even when other animals or people are in close proximity, skunks will ignore the intruders unless they are disturbed.</p>

				<p> Skunks are especially beneficial to farmers, gardeners, and landowners as they feed on pests. While young skunks are cute and kitten-like, they are wild animals and it is illegal to keep them as pets.</p>
